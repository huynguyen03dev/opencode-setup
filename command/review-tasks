Review the completed task(s) and code changes above against the following criteria:

1) Consistency with existing coding style and conventions.
2) Maintainability (clarity, modularity, testability, and separation of concerns).
3) Risk of future conflicts with other parts of the system (e.g., overlapping responsibilities, touching unstable or unrelated modules).
4) Correctness (does the code actually solve the stated problem?).

For each criterion:
- State whether the changes meet it (Yes/Mostly/No).
- Provide a brief justification.
- Suggest concrete improvements where appropriate.

Output format (Markdown):
- Section "Summary": 2–4 sentences overall assessment of the implementation.
- Section "Style & Conventions": bullets with findings and suggestions.
- Section "Maintainability": bullets with findings and suggestions.
- Section "Future Conflicts": bullets describing any risks and how to reduce them.
- Section "Actionable Changes": numbered list of specific edits to make to the code.
